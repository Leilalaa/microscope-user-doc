Blast & Pattern Searches
########################

The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool finds regions of local similarity between sequences. The program compares nucleotidic or protein sequences to sequence(s) stored in our database (PkGDB), and it computes the statistical significance of matches. This interface allows the user to compare the sequences at the nucleic level (BlastN) or proteic level (BlastP and tBlastN) or to search for nucleic or proteic patterns (Prosite format).
