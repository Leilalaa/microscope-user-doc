Genome Browser interface provides an user-friendly way to visualize and explore a replicon content 
(cartographic map of the genome), together with the similarity results (synteny maps) obtained with other 
bacterial genomes available in our PkGDB database (i.e, (re)annotation of bacterial genomes or 
complete proteome downloaded from the RefSeq/WGS sections). 
Artemis tool can be launched at this level to examine more precisely the nucleotidic/proteic sequences 
(a useful interface to correct translational start codon positions if necessary). 
For genomic objects drawn in part of the chromosome visualized in the cartographic map, additional information 
is listed in a table.
