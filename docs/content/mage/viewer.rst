Overview of the Genome Browser 
==============================

Organisation of the genomic map
-------------------------------

The MaGe genome browser is organised into 3 parts:

* the upper part of the window details the Coding Sequences (CDSs) that have been predicted for reading frames +1, +2 and +3 in the current region
* the middle part indicates the position of RNA objects (rRNA, tRNA, misc_RNA) as well as repeated regions (as turquoise rectangles) if any have been detected
* the bottom part of the window shows CDSs that have been predicted for reading frames -1, -2 and -3

The predicted CDSs are indicated by rectangles on each frame.

The blue lines symbolize the coding prediction curve. They increase when coding probability is high and drop when the coding probability is low.

What is the meaning of the Genomic Object color code ?
------------------------------------------------------

The rectangles symbolising each Genomic Object (CDS, RNA...) follow a color code that corresponds to their annotation status, summarized below:
