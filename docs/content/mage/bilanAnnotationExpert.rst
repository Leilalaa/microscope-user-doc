Expert Annotation Summary 
#########################

This tool provides a general overview of the expert annotations perform on protein genes for the selected genome, 
mainly the number of validated CDSs, and their distribution in Product Type and Cellular Localization categories 
(Riley M «Functions of the gene products of Escherichia coli.» Microbiol Rev. 1993 Dec;57(4):862-952. ) 
and Evidence Classes (inspired from http://www.pseudomonas.com/). These statistics does not include the automatic 
functional annotations.
