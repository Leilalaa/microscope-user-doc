How to use my favourites organisms selection?
---------------------------------------------

By moving your pointer on hover the *Change* button, a popup will appear, displaying your own organisms selection for a quick access to reference sequences. If you click on one of the organism’s link displayed in this popup, the system will set the chosen organism as the new reference one.

.. tip:: This functionality doesn’t modify the Click action for the Change button. Clicking on this button will still open a selection interface that will allow the annotator to choose a new reference organism within the full set of available ones.

So, make sure to differentiate the **Click / Move hover** actions of your pointer on the *Change* button.
