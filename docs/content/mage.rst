The MaGe genome browser is organised into 3 parts:

the upper part of the window details the Coding Sequences (CDSs) that have been predicted for reading frames +1, +2 and +3 in the current region
the middle part indicates the position of RNA objects (rRNA, tRNA, misc_RNA) as well as repeated regions (as turquoise rectangles) if any have been detected
the bottom part of the window shows CDSs that have been predicted for reading frames -1, -2 and -3
The predicted CDSs are indicated by rectangles on each frame.
