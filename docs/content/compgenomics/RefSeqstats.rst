RefSeq Synteny Statistics
#########################


This tool provides some statistics about the similarity results between the selected organism and all the bacterial genomes available in RefSeq/WGS NCBI sections.

Among the computed values between two compared genomes are: the number and percentage of genes which are in BBH (Bidirectional Best Hit) and in synteny groups, the synteny groups number and size, etc.
