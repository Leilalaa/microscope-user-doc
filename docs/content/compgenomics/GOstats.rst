PkGDB Synteny Statistics 
########################

This tool provides some statistics about the similarity results between the selected organism and all the genomes available in our PkGDB database.

Among the computed values between two compared genomes are: the number and percentage of genes which are in BBH (Bidirectional Best Hit) and in synteny groups, the synteny groups number and size, etc.

Note that, given the MicroScope re-annotation procedure on public genomes integrated in PkGDB, these values can slightly be different from the ones obtained in the section "RefSeq Synteny Statistics".
