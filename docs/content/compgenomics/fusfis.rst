Fusion / Fission
################

This tool provides a list of candidate genes of a query genome potentially involved in a fusion or a fission event. These events are computed from the synteny results obtained with the genomes available in the PkGDB database. They are ordered using a score which reflect the "originality" of the event. The lowest scores are generally associated to events predicted because of the presence of pseudogenes either in the query genome (fission) or in the compared genomes (fusion).
