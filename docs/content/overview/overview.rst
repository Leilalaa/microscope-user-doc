Interface
=========
Most of result tables provides a default sort (grey-coloured column). 
To sort results as you wish, simply click on the corresponding column header. Each click will alternate between ASC (ascending order) sort or DESC (descending order) sort. 
Also, the system provides a multi-sort functionality, to sort and switch on multiple columns. Simply hold your «SHIFT» key and click on column headers you want to multi-sort.
