* **Item #1. Login Interface:** 
Fill the username and password fields as described in the Email sent to you at account creation. After you login, you will have access to all public sequences, as well as private sequences corresponding to your project. Furthermore, you may have annotation rights on certain sequences (if defined in your account parameters).

**Tip**: Considering the account creation: **we will create new accounts *only* following requests from project leaders**. Please ask your project leader to use his own «**Account & Right Management**» interface in order to open your account.
